### title: Momemtum Snowflake with Data Robot Country Analysis
#### date: March 22, 2021
### Project Description
Clean and prepare a data set to learn Snowflake with Data Robot

##### Subject area and questions
Select a simple subject area: country Gini Index and country characteristics. The Gini Index is a measure of wealth inequality. The Gini Index and Gini Gain are also formulas used in decision trees and chosen to build greater understanding of the algorithm.
  
Downloaded data sets from: 

https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/gini-coefficient-by-country

https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/environment-social-and-governance-data

#### The First Step is to analyze and understand the data.

These are very small data sets without any column descriptions. Initial analyis will occur in Excel. Some data cleansing will also be done manually.
